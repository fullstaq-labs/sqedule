## What counts as a contribution?

Anything that helps improving the project, whether directly (through a pull request) or indirectly (by engaging with us) counts as a contribution. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

 * Reporting an issue.
 * Triaging issues: determining whether an issue report is clear enough, whether the issue still persists, and whether it is reproducible.
 * Updating documentation.
 * Proposing an improvement.
 * Sending a pull request.
 * Reviewing someone else's pull request.
