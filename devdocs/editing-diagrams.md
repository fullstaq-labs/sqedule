# Editing diagrams

All diagrams are made in [Diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) (formerly Draw.io). They are stored in the repository as _SVG files with embedded Diagrams.net content_.

The recommended way to edit these files locally is with [Visual Studio Code's Draw.io integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio).
