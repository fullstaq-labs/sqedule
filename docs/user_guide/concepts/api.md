# API

The Sqedule server provides an HTTP JSON API. Both the [web interface](web-interface.md) and the [CLI](cli.md) make use of the API.

There is currently no authentication because the server [does not support that yet](../../server_guide/concepts/security.md), although the server administrator can choose put to Sqedule behind a reverse proxy that puts up HTTP Basic Authentication.
