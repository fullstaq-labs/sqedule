# Introduction

To [use Sqedule](../user_guide/index.md), one must run a Sqedule server. This guide covers server installation and administration.

The server is an HTTP server and [requires a database](installation/requirements.md). We do not provide a hosted version, so you must run it yourself on your own infrastructure. Luckily, this is easy: we provide [pre-compiled binaries](installation/binary.md) and [containers](installation/container.md). Even [running on Kubernetes](installation/kubernetes.md) is a breeze.

Please review the navigation menu and select your favorite installation method.
