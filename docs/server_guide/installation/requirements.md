# Installation requirements

The Sqedule server requires PostgreSQL >= 13. Other databases may be supported in the future depending on user demand.

!!! note
    You don't need to manually setup database schemas. The Sqedule server [takes care of that automatically during startup](../concepts/database-schema-migration.md).
